**Candy-Spoof** is a bidirectional IP spoofing tunnel designed for use in heavily censored networks. Both the client and server forge their source IP addresses, making traffic analysis and blocking significantly harder.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Mutual IP spoofing | Both client and server use fake source addresses |
| Spoofed-IP pools | Rotate source addresses per session for better evasion |
| Data channel | Spoofed UDP with configurable port |
| Control channel | Spoofed ICMP Echo Request/Reply (looks like ping traffic) |
| Reliable delivery | Selective Repeat ARQ with per-packet retransmission |
| Congestion control | TCP-like AIMD: slow-start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit, RTT estimation (RFC 6298) |
| SOCKS5 proxy | Local proxy on port 1080 – route any app through the tunnel |
| Whitelist validation | Packets from unknown IPs are silently dropped |
| Multiple tunnels | Configurable number of parallel independent tunnels |
| Pre-shared key | Optional PSK for packet authentication |

## Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Linux (requires raw socket support)
- **Permissions**: `CAP_NET_RAW` capability or root access
- **Compiler**: Rust 1.70 or later (edition 2021)

## Building from Source

Build the project using Cargo:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binaries will be available at:
- Client: `target/release/client`
- Server: `target/release/server`

## Usage

### Running the Server

Start the server with the configuration file:

```bash
sudo ./target/release/server --config config/server.toml
```

Or during development:

```bash
sudo cargo run --bin server -- --config config/server.toml
```

### Running the Client

Start the client with the configuration file:

```bash
sudo ./target/release/client --config config/client.toml
```

After starting the client, configure your applications (browser, curl, etc.) to use the SOCKS5 proxy at `127.0.0.1:1080`.

## Configuration

| Field | Where | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `real_ip` | both | Your machine's actual IPv4 address |
| `peer_real_ip` | both | The peer's actual IPv4 address |
| `spoofed_ip` | both | The fake source IP for outgoing packets |
| `peer_spoofed_ip` | both | The fake source IP the peer uses |
| `spoofed_ip_pool` | both | Optional pool of source IPs to rotate |
| `data_port` | both | UDP port for the data channel (must match) |
| `icmp_id` | both | ICMP echo identifier (must match) |
| `pre_shared_key` | both | Secret for packet authentication (must match) |
| `allowed_peers` | both | Extra IPs to whitelist |
| `interface` | both | Network interface (e.g. `eth0`) |
| `socks5_port` | client | Local SOCKS5 proxy port (default `1080`) |
| `tunnel_count` | both | Number of parallel tunnels (default `4`) |
| `mtu` | both | Max payload bytes per packet (default `1380`) |
| `initial_cwnd` | both | Initial congestion window in packets (default `10`) |
| `spoof_outbound` | both | If `false`, send outbound packets with the real source IP instead of spoofing |

**Note**: Both client and server configurations must match on critical fields like `data_port`, `icmp_id`, and `pre_shared_key` for the tunnel to work properly.

Refer to `config/client.toml` and `config/server.toml` for complete configuration examples.

### Asymmetric / Xray-backed mode

For deployments where one side cannot spoof outbound packets directly and must
use a normal-IP backchannel such as Xray/VLESS, use the interactive installer:

```bash
chmod +x deploy/asym/setup-interactive.sh
sudo ./deploy/asym/setup-interactive.sh
```

The installer prompts for the required values, explains each prompt, and sets
`spoof_outbound = false` only for the Xray-backed side. The main repository
defaults remain unchanged.

## How It Works

```
[Application]
     │  TCP (SOCKS5 CONNECT)
     ▼
[SOCKS5 Proxy – 127.0.0.1:1080]
     │  Candy-Spoof data (ARQ + CC)
     ▼
[Raw UDP – src=spoofed_client_ip  dst=real_server_ip]
─── censored network ──────────────────────────────────
[Tunnel Manager – server demultiplexes by tunnel_id]
     │  TCP
     ▼
[Target Server]
     │
     ▼
[Raw UDP – src=spoofed_server_ip  dst=real_client_ip]
─── censored network ──────────────────────────────────
[Application receives response]
```

**Control Channel**: Control packets (SYN, ACK, NACK, Heartbeat) use ICMP Echo Request/Reply messages to blend with ordinary ping traffic, making detection more difficult.

## ARQ & Congestion Control

- **Selective Repeat ARQ** – only missing packets retransmitted; out-of-order
  packets buffered until gap is filled.
- **Slow-start** – window grows exponentially from `initial_cwnd` until `ssthresh`.
- **Congestion avoidance** – additive increase of ~+1 per RTT.
- **Fast retransmit** – triggered on 3 duplicate ACKs; window halved.
- **Timeout** – window reset to 1, exponential RTO back-off (up to 60 s).
- **RTT estimation** – Jacobson/Karels algorithm (RFC 6298).

## Security Considerations

- **Minimize privileges**: Use `CAP_NET_RAW` capability instead of running as full root when possible
- **Protect credentials**: Keep `pre_shared_key` secret and rotate it regularly
- **Choose spoofed IPs carefully**: Use globally routable addresses that are not yours; CDN or public DNS addresses help blend traffic patterns
- **Be aware of limitations**: Ingress filtering (BCP 38) on upstream routers may block packets with spoofed source addresses
- **Legal compliance**: Ensure you have authorization to use this tool in your network environment

## Performance Tips

- Increase `tunnel_count` for higher parallelism on fast links.
- Tune `mtu` to match path MTU (`tracepath` helps).
- Raise `initial_cwnd` (e.g. `30`) on low-latency links to reduce slow-start
  ramp-up time.
- Use a `spoofed_ip_pool` of 3–5 addresses to distribute traffic patterns.
